    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pan Seared steak is a very simple process and produces the most
        mouth-watering steaks. Any tender cut of steak will do,
        well marbled steaks give the best results.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
     <li>Steak</li>
     <li>Butter</li>
     <li>Aromatics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
     <li>Use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear 
        and reduce oil splatter.</li>
     <li>Just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
     <li>On medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
     <li>Add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed
        then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
     <li>Melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs.
        Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
     <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
