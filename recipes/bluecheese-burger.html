    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is the most savory burger known to man bar none, hands down.
        read below to find out how to make this amazing dish.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>2 Tbs. unsalted butter</li>
     <li>2 medium yellow onions, chopped (about 2 cups)</li>
     <li>1-1/2 lb. ground beef (preferably 85% lean)</li>
     <li>1 Tbs. chopped fresh tarragon</li>
     <li>1 Tbs. Dijon mustard</li>
     <li>1 Tbs. Worcestershire sauce</li>
     <li>Vegetable oil, for the grill</li>
     <li>4 oz. blue cheese, crumbled (about 1 cup)</li>
     <li>4 brioche or challah rolls, split</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Prepare a medium-high gas or charcoal grill fire.</li>
     <li>Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. 
        Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until golden and soft, about 20 minutes;
        reduce the heat to low if the onions begin to brown too quickly.</li>
     <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, thoroughly mix the beef, tarragon, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce with your hands.
        Form the mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.</li>
     <li>Oil the grill grate. Grill the burgers, covered, for 3 minutes. Flip the burgers and top with the cheese.
        Cover and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into a burger registers 130°F for medium rare,
        about 4 minutes more, or 145°F for medium, about 6 minutes more.</li>
     <li>When the burgers are nearly done, toast the rolls cut side down on the grill until browned and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.
        Serve the burgers in the rolls, topped with the caramelized onions.</li>
    </ol>
